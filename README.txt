How long did the assignment take?
{A1: 8 hours}
Potential issues with your solution and explanation of partial completion (for partial credit)
{A2: I can't find anything wrong with my code. However for the multiple pano, the ones on the very edges tend to have small jumps on the seams. One issue might just be that the clicks aren't as accurate as I'd like them to be. However the vast majority of the seams look the way they should be.}
Any extra credit you may have implemented
{A3: none}
Collaboration acknowledgement (but again, you must write your own code)
{A4: none}
What was most unclear/difficult?
{A5: Extending from 2 to N, and figuring out how to handle the two cases greater than and less than the ref image.}
What was most exciting?
{A6: Making the pano stitch properly!}
For 6.865 what was the speed-up from using bounding boxes?
{A7: 375-165 = 210 seconds}
